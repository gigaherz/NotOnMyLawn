What is NotOnMyLawn?
--------------------

NotOnMyLawn is a [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) plugin that controls the spawning of mobs around man-made 
structures. It is strongly inspired by sluvine's [CivilizedSpawn](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/mech-civilizedspawn-v1-0-keep-monsters-out-of-civilized-areas-1185.8206/), but using 
completely new code.
